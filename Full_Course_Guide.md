---

### **🧭 Course Logic**

The course is structured around four progressive *learning arcs* that reflect both the evolution of computer vision and the cognitive progression from perception to synthesis.

Together, they culminate in 17 learning outcomes that bridge technical mastery, interpretive insight, and responsible practice.

---

### **Arc 1 — Foundations of Seeing (Weeks 0–3)**

> From imagery to interpretation.
> 

Build technical and conceptual literacy in remote sensing, geospatial data handling, and classical computer vision. Students move from exploring spectral signatures to developing their first convolutional models.

**Focus Topics:**

- Spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, NDBI)
- Radiometry and resolution trade-offs
- CNN architectures and interpretability (Grad-CAM)
- Bias, data geography, and the ethics of “seeing”

**Capstone Contribution:**

Establishes the reproducible workspace, dataset boundaries, and baseline CNN model.

---

### **Arc 2 — Learning to Represent (Weeks 4–6)**

> From labels to latent meaning.
> 

Transition from supervised learning toward unsupervised, transfer, and self-supervised approaches that allow models to *discover* structure within data.

Students visualize and interpret embeddings, laying the groundwork for multimodal reasoning.

**Focus Topics:**

- Transfer learning and multi-sensor data fusion
- Representation visualization (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
- Self-supervised learning (SimCLR, BYOL)
- Peer review and interpretive communication

**Capstone Contribution:**

Creates the first robust, reusable feature representation pipeline and visual interpretation framework.

---

### **Arc 3 — Learning to Reason (Weeks 7–10)**

> From perception to planetary reasoning.
> 

Apply advanced architectures that combine vision, language, and global-scale pretraining to interpret Earth processes.

Students engage with transformer architectures and geospatial foundation models to reason about planetary patterns and ethical implications.

**Focus Topics:**

- Vision Transformers (ViT) and multimodal CLIP models
- Geospatial foundation models (Prithvi 2.0, Granite Geo, Alpha Earth)
- Cross-model integration and reproducibility audits
- Responsible AI and environmental ethics

**Capstone Contribution:**

Develops the full technical pipeline and comparative model evaluation forming the backbone of the final synthesis.

---

### **Arc 4 — Learning to Integrate & Reflect (Weeks 11–12)**

> From models to meaning.
> 

Synthesize all learned methods into dynamic, interpretable Earth system analyses.

Students model temporal and relational processes (e.g., vegetation change, water quality, parcel connectivity) and produce a final open-science portfolio with ethical reflection and curriculum translation.

**Focus Topics:**

- Spatiotemporal models (ConvLSTM, Temporal Transformers)
- Graph neural networks for spatial connectivity (GAT)
- Regenerative and Responsible AI frameworks
- Capstone symposium and open-science publication readiness

**Capstone Contribution:**

Culminates in the *Earth Vision Synthesis Portfolio* — an integrated pipeline, visualization dashboard, Responsible GeoAI essay, and graduate-course reflection memo.

---

### **🌱 Course Ethos**

This course embodies three core principles that guide every technical and reflective component:

1. **Openness:** All workflows use open-source tools and FAIR-compliant practices for global accessibility.
2. **Interpretability:** Models are never black boxes; visualization and explanation are integral to learning.
3. **Regeneration:** Every analysis asks not only *what the model sees*, but *what futures it can support* — emphasizing social and ecological wellbeing.

---

---

---

### **C. Applied Reasoning — Learning to Reason (Arc 3)**
