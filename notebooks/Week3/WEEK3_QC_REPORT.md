## 10. Issues Found and Recommendations

### Critical Issues: NONE ✅

### Warnings ⚠️

1. **Output Directory Locations**
   - **Issue:** Unclear where `phase1_outputs/` and `phase2_outputs/` should be created
   - **Current:** README says `Week3/phase1_outputs/`
   - **May be:** Actually in `notebooks/phase1_outputs/` (parent directory)
   - **Recommendation:** Run Phase 1-2 and verify output paths, update notebooks if needed
   - **Impact:** LOW (students can adjust paths)

2. **phase1_config.json Removal**
   - **Issue:** File was removed during cleanup, but may have historical value
   - **Current:** Phase2 uses fallback values (works fine)
   - **Recommendation:** Document in README that config is optional
   - **Impact:** NONE (fallback works correctly)

3. **Screenshot Gaps**
   - **Issue:** Phase0 README could benefit from more QGIS screenshots
   - **Current:** Text-based instructions
   - **Recommendation:** Add 5-10 screenshots for visual learners
   - **Impact:** LOW (instructions are clear without them)

### Informational Notes ℹ️

1. **Phase2 README References Scripts**
   - **Note:** README documents 8-script approach, but notebook supersedes
   - **Recommendation:** Add note at top of Phase2 README: "This phase is now implemented as a notebook. Script documentation retained for reference."
   - **Impact:** NONE (historical context is valuable)

2. **PyTorch vs TensorFlow**
   - **Note:** Week_3_Lab.ipynb uses PyTorch, Phase3 uses TensorFlow
   - **Status:** Both approaches are valid
   - **Recommendation:** Mention in master README that two framework options exist
   - **Impact:** POSITIVE (provides student choice)

3. **File Size of Phase3**
   - **Note:** 328 KB is large (may have executed outputs embedded)
   - **Recommendation:** Consider clearing outputs before distribution to reduce size
   - **Impact:** NONE (large size not a problem)
