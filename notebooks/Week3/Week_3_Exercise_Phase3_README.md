# Week 3 Activity 1: Phase 3 - CNN Training & Evaluation

## Overview

Phase 3 completes the Week 3 workflow by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the dataset created in Phases 0-2. This phase transforms validated patches into a working land cover classification model.

## What is Phase 3?

**Phase 3** is the CNN training and evaluation phase:
- Load 375 high-quality patches from Phase 2
- Build CNN architecture optimized for 8×8 pixel patches
- Train model with proper monitoring and callbacks
- Evaluate performance with comprehensive metrics
- Visualize learned features and predictions
- Interpret model behavior and limitations

**Flow**: Phase 0 (Polygons) → Phase 1 (Validate) → Phase 2 (Extract) → **Phase 3 (Train CNN)**

### ✅ Model Architecture

```
SimpleCNN Architecture:
  Input:  8×8×6 (height × width × bands)

  Conv Block 1:
    - Conv2D(32 filters, 3×3 kernel, same padding)
    - BatchNormalization
    - ReLU activation
    - MaxPooling2D(2×2) → 4×4×32

  Conv Block 2:
    - Conv2D(64 filters, 3×3 kernel, same padding)
    - BatchNormalization
    - ReLU activation
    - MaxPooling2D(2×2) → 2×2×64

  Dense Layers:
    - Flatten → 256 features
    - Dense(128) + ReLU
    - Dropout(0.5)
    - Dense(5) + Softmax

  Output: 5-class probability distribution

  Total Parameters: 54,181 (211 KB)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **Shallow network** - Small 8×8 patches don't need deep architecture
- **BatchNorm** - Stabilizes training with limited data
- **Dropout (0.5)** - Prevents overfitting on 300 training samples
- **Small kernel (3×3)** - Appropriate for 8×8 input
- **Two conv blocks** - Sufficient to learn spectral-spatial patterns

### ✅ Training Configuration

```
Training Setup:
  Optimizer:        Adam (lr=0.001)
  Loss Function:    Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
  Batch Size:       32
  Max Epochs:       50
  Early Stopping:   Patience 10 (val_loss)
  ReduceLR:         Patience 5, factor 0.5

Training Data:
  Training:         300 patches (80%)
  Validation:       75 patches (20%)
  Classes:          5 (Agriculture, Forest, Parcels, Urban, Water)
  Data Quality:     100% success rate, 0% NaN

Callbacks:
  1. ModelCheckpoint - Save best val_accuracy
  2. EarlyStopping - Stop if val_loss plateaus
  3. ReduceLROnPlateau - Halve LR if stuck
```

                     for pid in train_split['patch_id']])
y_train = train_split['class_name'].map(CLASS_MAP).values

# Normalize
X_train_norm = X_train / 10000.0  # [0, 10000] → [0, 1]
```

## Understanding the Results

### Confusion Matrix Interpretation

The confusion matrix shows true labels (rows) vs predicted labels (columns):

```
              Predicted
              Agr  For  Par  Urb  Wat
True  Agr      17    0    0    4    0
      For       0   10    0    0    0
      Par       0    0   13    6    0
      Urb       0    0    0   17    0
      Wat       0    0    0    0    8
```

**Key Observations:**
- **Perfect classes:** Forest (10/10), Water (8/8) - No errors!
- **Strong:** Agriculture (17/21 = 81%)
- **Moderate:** Parcels (13/19 = 68%) - 6 confused with Urban
- **Confusion pattern:** Parcels ↔ Urban (cyan parcels vs gray buildings)

**Why the confusion?**
- Parcels have bright cyan signatures (plastic/metal)
- Urban has reflective roofs (similar spectral signature)
- 8×8 patches may not capture enough spatial context
- Solution: Increase patch size or add more training data

### Training Curves Interpretation

**Loss Curves:**
- Training loss decreases steadily (model learning)
- Validation loss decreases but may plateau
- **Gap between curves** indicates overfitting risk
- Early stopping prevents overtraining

**Accuracy Curves:**
- Both curves should rise
- Validation accuracy plateaus around 85-90%
- Best epoch typically 20-30 (early stopping activated)

**Healthy Training Signs:**
- ✅ Smooth curves (not erratic)
- ✅ Validation tracks training (not diverging)
- ✅ No sudden spikes (stable learning)

**Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Validation loss rises while training falls (overfitting)
- ⚠️ Erratic validation accuracy (need more data)
- ⚠️ Both curves plateau early (underfitting, increase capacity)

### Per-Class Performance Analysis

**Tier 1: Excellent (F1 = 1.00)**
- **Forest** - Distinctive dark green NIR signature
- **Water** - Unique low reflectance across all bands

**Tier 2: Strong (F1 = 0.85)**
- **Agriculture** - Moderate confusion with other classes
- Bare soil vs crops varies

**Tier 3: Moderate (F1 = 0.81)**
- **Parcels** - Confused with Urban (similar materials)
- **Urban** - High recall (100%), low precision (68%)
  - Meaning: Catches all urban, but calls some parcels urban

**Improvement Strategies:**
1. Collect more training samples for confused classes
2. Increase patch size to capture spatial patterns
3. Add data augmentation (rotation, flip)
4. Use class weights to handle imbalance

---

## Key Features of Phase 3 Pipeline

### 1. Proper Data Handling

**Normalization:**
```python
X_train_norm = X_train / 10000.0  # Sentinel-2 range → [0, 1]
```

**Why normalize?**
- Neural networks train better on [0, 1] or [-1, 1] range
- Original values (0-10000) cause large gradients
- Faster convergence, better performance

**Class Mapping:**
```python
CLASS_NAMES = ['Agriculture', 'Forest', 'Parcels', 'Urban', 'Water']
CLASS_MAP = {name: idx for idx, name in enumerate(CLASS_NAMES)}
```

### 2. Robust Training Configuration

**Adam Optimizer:**
- Adaptive learning rate per parameter
- Momentum helps escape local minima
- Default lr=0.001 works well for CNNs

**Sparse Categorical Crossentropy:**
- Standard for multi-class classification
- Accepts integer labels (0-4) not one-hot
- Efficient for >2 classes

**Callbacks:**
- **ModelCheckpoint:** Always have best model saved
- **EarlyStopping:** Don't waste time overtraining
- **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Escape plateaus by lowering LR

### 3. Comprehensive Evaluation

**Multiple Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness (good for balanced data)
- **Precision:** Of predicted positives, how many correct?
- **Recall:** Of actual positives, how many found?
- **F1:** Harmonic mean of precision/recall

**Why not just accuracy?**
- Imbalanced classes mislead accuracy
- Agriculture (28%) vs Water (10%)
- Need per-class metrics to see true performance

**Confusion Matrix:**
- Shows **where** errors occur
- Identifies class pairs that confuse model
- Guides data collection and improvement

### 4. Visualization for Understanding

**Sample Patches by Class:**
- Verify data quality
- See spectral signatures visually
- Identify mislabeled data

**Training Curves:**
- Monitor training health
- Detect overfitting early
- Choose best stopping point

**Prediction Samples:**
- Qualitative assessment
- Build intuition for model behavior
- Find systematic errors

---

## Model Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Small Training Set (300 samples)

**Impact:**
- Risk of overfitting (memorizing training data)
- May not generalize to new regions
- Limited examples per class (31-84 samples)

**Mitigation:**
- Dropout (0.5) prevents overfitting
- Early stopping avoids overtraining
- Spatial jitter in Phase 2 adds diversity

**Future Improvement:**
- Collect more training polygons
- Apply data augmentation (rotation, flip, brightness)
- Use transfer learning from larger datasets

### 2. Patch Size Constraint (8×8 pixels)

**Impact:**
- Small spatial context (80m × 80m)
- May miss landscape patterns
- Fine-scale features only

**Trade-off:**
- Larger patches (16×16) need bigger polygons
- Our smallest class (Urban) limited to 8×8
- Could filter small classes and use larger patches

**Future Improvement:**
- Re-digitize with larger polygons
- Use multi-scale approach (8×8 + 16×16)
- Implement sliding window at inference

### 3. Class Imbalance

**Current Distribution:**
- Agriculture: 28% (84 samples)
- Parcels: 26% (77 samples)
- Urban: 23% (70 samples)
- Forest: 13% (38 samples)
- Water: 10% (31 samples)

**Impact:**
- Model biased toward frequent classes
- Rare classes (Water, Forest) harder to learn
- But: Results show Water/Forest perform best!

**Mitigation:**
- Stratified splitting preserves ratios
- Could use class weights in training
- Could oversample minority classes

### 4. Geographic Limitation

**Training Region:**
- Los Lagos Region, Chile only
- Specific climate (temperate)
- Specific land use patterns

**Generalization Risk:**
- May not work in other climates
- Different spectral signatures elsewhere
- Urban in Chile ≠ Urban in Africa/Asia

**Future Improvement:**
- Test on independent regions
- Fine-tune for new locations
- Build multi-regional dataset

### 5. Temporal Constraint

**Imagery Date:**
- 2019 median composite
- Single growing season
- No temporal dynamics

**Limitation:**
- Agriculture changes seasonally
- Can't capture phenology
- Fixed snapshot in time

**Future Improvement:**
- Multi-date time series
- Temporal CNN or LSTM
- Phenology-aware features

## Comparison: Phase 2 vs Phase 3

| Aspect | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Scope** | Extract 375 patches | Train CNN on patches |
| **Purpose** | Create dataset | Build classifier |
| **Duration** | ~45 minutes | ~15 minutes |
| **Main Output** | patch_*.npy files | best_model.h5 |
| **Key Metric** | 0% NaN, 100% success | 86.67% accuracy |
| **Validation** | 10 integrity checks | Confusion matrix, metrics |

---

## Using the Trained Model

### Loading the Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('models/week3/best_model.h5')

# Load new patch (8×8×6)
new_patch = np.load('path/to/new_patch.npy')
new_patch_norm = new_patch / 10000.0  # Normalize!

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(new_patch_norm[np.newaxis, ...])
class_idx = np.argmax(prediction)
confidence = prediction[0, class_idx]

CLASS_NAMES = ['Agriculture', 'Forest', 'Parcels', 'Urban', 'Water']
print(f"Predicted: {CLASS_NAMES[class_idx]} ({confidence*100:.1f}% confidence)")
```

### Applying to Full Study Area

**Process:**
1. Extract patches from full composite (sliding window)
2. Normalize each patch
3. Predict with trained model
4. Aggregate predictions to map
5. Apply post-processing (modal filter, etc.)

**Considerations:**
- **Computational cost:** Full study area = millions of patches
- **Edge effects:** Patches at boundaries may be incomplete
- **Overlap:** Use overlapping windows for smoother results
- **Batch prediction:** Process 1000s of patches at once

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Low validation accuracy (<70%)

**Possible causes:**
- Poor data quality (check Phase 2 quality metrics)
- Insufficient training data
- Model too complex (overfitting)
- Model too simple (underfitting)

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Check data quality
train_split = pd.read_csv('phase2_outputs/metadata/train_split.csv')
print(train_split['nan_pct'].describe())  # Should be near 0%

# 2. Increase training samples
# Re-run Phase 0 with more polygons

# 3. Reduce model complexity
model = create_simple_cnn()  # Already simple!

# 4. Increase model capacity
# Add another conv block or more filters
```

### Issue: Validation accuracy much lower than training

**Symptom:**
- Training accuracy: 95%
- Validation accuracy: 70%
- **Overfitting!**

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Increase dropout
layers.Dropout(0.7)  # Was 0.5

# 2. Add L2 regularization
layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l2(0.01))

# 3. Reduce model capacity
layers.Conv2D(16, ...)  # Was 32 filters

# 4. Early stopping (already implemented)
```

### Issue: Training loss not decreasing

**Symptom:**
- Loss stays high (>2.0 after 10 epochs)
- Accuracy near random (20% for 5 classes)

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Check learning rate
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)  # Was 0.001

# 2. Check normalization
print(X_train_norm.min(), X_train_norm.max())  # Should be [0, 1]

# 3. Check labels
print(np.unique(y_train))  # Should be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# 4. Try different optimizer
optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)
```

### Issue: Out of memory error

**Symptom:**
```
ResourceExhaustedError: OOM when allocating tensor
```

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Reduce batch size
config['batch_size'] = 16  # Was 32

# 2. Use mixed precision (if GPU available)
policy = keras.mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(policy)

# 3. Train on CPU (slower but works)
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '-1'
```

### Issue: Class imbalance causing poor minority class performance

**Symptom:**
- Forest: 100% F1
- Water: 100% F1
- But: Model predicts majority class too often

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Use class weights
class_counts = np.bincount(y_train)
class_weights = {i: len(y_train) / (len(class_counts) * count)
                 for i, count in enumerate(class_counts)}

history = model.fit(
    X_train_norm, y_train,
    class_weight=class_weights,  # Add this!
    ...
)

# 2. Oversample minority classes
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = ros.fit_resample(
    X_train_norm.reshape(len(X_train_norm), -1), y_train
)
X_train_resampled = X_train_resampled.reshape(-1, 8, 8, 6)
```
