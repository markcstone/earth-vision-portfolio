**Course:** GeoAI and Earth Vision: Foundations to Frontier Applications  
**Arc:** Arc 2 — Learning to Represent (Weeks 4-6)  
**Theme:** "Building on What's Been Learned: Transfer Learning and Multi-Sensor Fusion"  
**Duration:** ~8-10 hours

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 4, you will be able to:

1. Implement transfer learning with pretrained CNNs (ResNet-50); EfficientNet-B0 excluded here due to a known bug in this environment.
2. Prepare and fuse multi-sensor inputs (Sentinel-2, MODIS NDVI, SRTM DEM) into aligned 8-band tensors.
3. Modify and fine-tune pretrained backbones for multispectral inputs using appropriate freezing and learning rates.
4. Evaluate models with quantitative metrics and ablations (single-sensor vs fusion, frozen vs fine-tuned).
5. Document a reproducible baseline pipeline with saved configs, artifacts, and comparative results.
6. **Critically evaluate when transfer learning helps vs hurts, and recognize that negative results are scientifically valid and instructive.**

## Opening Discussion and Review

### Connecting to Week 3

In Week 3, you built and trained SimpleCNN from scratch, achieving 86.67% validation accuracy on Los Lagos land cover classification. This was a significant accomplishment—you created training data, extracted patches, implemented spatial splitting, and trained a functional model. However, training from scratch has limitations:

- **Data hungry**: Requires large labeled datasets (you used 300 training patches)
- **Computationally expensive**: Training takes time and resources
- **Limited generalization**: Model only knows what it learned from your specific data
- **Reinventing the wheel**: Ignores decades of computer vision progress

### The Transfer Learning Revolution

What if you could leverage models trained on millions of images to jumpstart your Earth observation tasks? This is the promise of **transfer learning**—using knowledge learned from one task (ImageNet classification) to accelerate learning on another (Los Lagos land cover mapping).

**Key insight:** Early CNN layers learn universal features (edges, textures, shapes) that transfer across domains. Only the final layers need task-specific retraining.

### Today's Learning Journey

This week unfolds in five stages:

1. **Understanding Transfer Learning** — Why it works, when to use it, types of transfer
2. **Pretrained Model Architectures** — ResNet, EfficientNet, and their design principles
3. **Multi-Sensor Data Fusion** — Combining Sentinel-2, MODIS, and elevation data
4. **Implementation Strategy** — Fine-tuning workflows and best practices
5. **Evaluation and Comparison** — Measuring improvements over Week 3 baseline

By week's end, you'll have implemented and critically evaluated transfer learning and fusion approaches; outcomes may vary, and negative results are scientifically valuable.

## Core Content: Transfer Learning Fundamentals

### What is Transfer Learning?

**Transfer learning** is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. Instead of training a neural network from scratch (random weight initialization), you start with weights learned from a related task.

**Analogy:** Learning to play tennis after mastering badminton. You don't start from zero—you transfer knowledge about racket sports, hand-eye coordination, and court positioning. You only need to learn tennis-specific skills (serve technique, scoring rules).

### Why Transfer Learning Works for Earth Observation

**The Hierarchical Feature Learning Hypothesis:**

CNNs learn features hierarchically:
- **Layer 1-2** (early): Edges, corners, color blobs — **universal across all images**
- **Layer 3-4** (middle): Textures, patterns, simple shapes — **somewhat universal**
- **Layer 5+** (late): Object parts, complex patterns — **task-specific**

When you transfer from ImageNet to Earth observation:
- **Early layers** (edges, textures) are immediately useful for satellite imagery
- **Middle layers** (patterns) partially transfer (forest texture ≈ fur texture)
- **Late layers** (object recognition) need retraining for land cover classes

**Evidence:** Studies show ImageNet-pretrained models achieve 5-15% higher accuracy on remote sensing tasks compared to training from scratch, even with the same amount of labeled data.

### Types of Transfer Learning

**1. Feature Extraction (Frozen Backbone)**

- **Approach**: Freeze all pretrained layers, only train new classification head
- **When to use**: Very small dataset (<500 examples), domain very similar to ImageNet
- **Pros**: Fast training, no overfitting risk
- **Cons**: Limited adaptation to new domain

**2. Fine-Tuning (Unfrozen Backbone)**

- **Approach**: Unfreeze some/all pretrained layers, train with low learning rate
- **When to use**: Medium dataset (500-10,000 examples), domain somewhat different from ImageNet
- **Pros**: Better adaptation, higher accuracy
- **Cons**: Slower training, requires careful learning rate tuning
- **⚠️ Warning**: Freezing >80% of layers (aggressive freezing) can cause model collapse for satellite imagery

**3. Full Fine-Tuning**

- **Approach**: Unfreeze all layers, train entire network
- **When to use**: Large dataset (>10,000 examples)
- **Pros**: Maximum adaptation
- **Cons**: Can overfit if dataset too small

**For Week 4:** We'll experiment with **fine-tuning** (option 2) since you have 300 training patches. However, note that **transfer learning may underperform training from scratch** when:
- Domain mismatch is severe (ImageNet RGB vs multispectral satellite)
- Patches are very small (8×8 pixels)
- Freezing ratio is too aggressive (>80%)

**Recommendation**: If transfer learning fails, try (a) less aggressive freezing (50-70% instead of 85%), (b) larger patches (32×32 or 64×64 native, no upsampling), or (c) train SimpleCNN from scratch.

### Domain Shift: The Challenge

**Domain shift** occurs when the source domain (ImageNet: cats, dogs, cars) differs from the target domain (Earth observation: forests, agriculture, water).

**Key differences:**

| Aspect | ImageNet | Earth Observation |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Viewpoint** | Ground-level, oblique | Nadir (top-down) |
| **Scale** | Objects fill frame | Objects are small pixels |
| **Spectral bands** | RGB (3 bands) | Multispectral (6-12 bands) |
| **Texture importance** | Moderate | High (land cover = texture) |
| **Spatial context** | Less critical | Critical (surroundings matter) |

**Despite these differences**, transfer learning still works because:
- Edges and textures are universal
- Hierarchical feature learning transfers
- Fine-tuning adapts to new domain

---

## Pretrained Model Architectures

### ResNet: Residual Networks

**Key Innovation:** Skip connections (residual connections) that allow training very deep networks (50-152 layers) without vanishing gradients.

**Architecture:**

```
Input → Conv Block 1 → Residual Block 1 → Residual Block 2 → ... → Global Avg Pool → FC → Output
                ↓                    ↓
                └────────────────────┘ (skip connection)
```

**Residual Block:**

```python
# Pseudocode
def residual_block(x):
    identity = x  # Save input
    x = conv(x)
    x = batch_norm(x)
    x = relu(x)
    x = conv(x)
    x = batch_norm(x)
    x = x + identity  # Add skip connection
    x = relu(x)
    return x
```

**Why skip connections matter:**
- Allow gradients to flow directly backward
- Enable training 100+ layer networks
- Learn identity mapping when needed (don't force transformation)

**ResNet Variants:**
- **ResNet-18**: 18 layers, 11.7M parameters, fast
- **ResNet-50**: 50 layers, 25.6M parameters, **recommended for Week 4**
- **ResNet-101**: 101 layers, 44.5M parameters, overkill for small datasets

### EfficientNet: Compound Scaling

**Key Innovation:** Systematically scale network depth, width, and resolution together using a compound coefficient.

**Scaling Dimensions:**
- **Depth**: Number of layers (deeper = more complex features)
- **Width**: Number of channels per layer (wider = more features)
- **Resolution**: Input image size (higher = more detail)

**Traditional approach:** Scale one dimension at a time (often suboptimal)

**EfficientNet approach:** Scale all three dimensions proportionally:

```
depth = α^φ
width = β^φ
resolution = γ^φ
```

Where φ is the compound coefficient, and α, β, γ are constants found via grid search.

**EfficientNet Variants:**
- **EfficientNet-B0**: Baseline, 5.3M parameters
- **EfficientNet-B1 to B7**: Progressively larger, B7 has 66M parameters

**Why EfficientNet for Earth Observation:**
- More parameter-efficient than ResNet (better accuracy with fewer parameters)
- Designed for transfer learning
- Handles variable input sizes well (important for different patch sizes)

### Choosing Between ResNet and EfficientNet

| Criterion | ResNet-50 | EfficientNet-B0 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Parameters** | 25.6M | 5.3M |
| **Speed** | Fast | Moderate |
| **Accuracy (ImageNet)** | 76.1% | 77.1% |
| **Transfer performance** | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Memory usage** | Higher | Lower |
| **Community support** | Extensive | Growing |

**Recommendation for Week 4:** Use **ResNet-50**. EfficientNet-B0 is excluded here due to a known bug affecting this environment; results and examples use ResNet-50.

## Multi-Sensor Data Fusion

### Why Fuse Multiple Data Sources?

**Single-sensor limitations:**

**Sentinel-2 alone:**
- ✅ High spatial resolution (10m)
- ✅ Multiple spectral bands
- ❌ No temporal context within single image
- ❌ No elevation information
- ❌ Limited to optical wavelengths

**MODIS alone:**
- ✅ High temporal resolution (daily)
- ✅ Long time series (2000-present)
- ❌ Coarse spatial resolution (250-500m)
- ❌ Fewer spectral bands

**SRTM DEM alone:**
- ✅ Elevation and topography
- ❌ No spectral information
- ❌ Static (no temporal dimension)

**Fusion benefits:**
- **Complementary information**: Combine spatial detail (Sentinel-2) + temporal context (MODIS) + topography (DEM)
- **Improved accuracy**: Studies show 5-10% accuracy gains from fusion
- **Robustness**: Multiple sensors reduce impact of missing data

### Types of Data Fusion

**1. Pixel-Level Fusion (Early Fusion)**

Concatenate raw bands from multiple sensors before model input.

```
Sentinel-2 (6 bands) + MODIS NDVI (1 band) + DEM (1 band) = 8-band input
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- Model learns optimal feature combinations
- Maximum information preserved

**Cons:**
- Requires spatial alignment (resampling)
- Higher computational cost
- Model must learn to integrate disparate sources

**2. Feature-Level Fusion (Middle Fusion)**

Extract features from each sensor separately, then concatenate before classification.

```
Sentinel-2 → CNN → Features (128-dim)
MODIS → CNN → Features (64-dim)
DEM → CNN → Features (32-dim)
Concatenate → [224-dim] → Classifier
```

**Pros:**
- Each sensor processed optimally
- Can use different architectures per sensor
- More flexible

**Cons:**
- More complex architecture
- Requires more training data
- Harder to interpret

**3. Decision-Level Fusion (Late Fusion)**

Train separate models per sensor, combine predictions.

```
Sentinel-2 → Model A → Prediction A
MODIS → Model B → Prediction B
DEM → Model C → Prediction C
Ensemble (voting/averaging) → Final Prediction
```

**Pros:**
- Simplest to implement
- Can use existing single-sensor models
- Interpretable (see each sensor's contribution)

**Cons:**
- Doesn't learn cross-sensor relationships
- Often lower accuracy than early/middle fusion

**For Week 4:** We'll use **pixel-level fusion** (early fusion) for simplicity and effectiveness.

### Spatial Alignment Challenges

**Problem:** Different sensors have different spatial resolutions:
- Sentinel-2: 10m
- MODIS: 250m
- SRTM DEM: 30m

**Solution:** Resample all to common resolution (10m for Week 4)

**Resampling methods:**
- **Nearest neighbor**: Fast, preserves values, blocky appearance
- **Bilinear**: Smooth, averages nearby pixels
- **Cubic**: Smoothest, best for continuous data (DEM)

**Best practices:**
- Resample coarser data (MODIS, DEM) to finer resolution (Sentinel-2)
- Use bilinear for MODIS (continuous values)
- Use cubic for DEM (smooth elevation)
- Never downsample high-resolution data unnecessarily

### Temporal Alignment

**Challenge:** Sensors have different revisit times:
- Sentinel-2: 5 days
- MODIS: Daily

**Strategies:**
1. **Temporal compositing**: Use median/mean over time window (e.g., austral summer)
2. **Nearest date matching**: Find MODIS image closest to Sentinel-2 date
3. **Temporal interpolation**: Interpolate MODIS between dates

**For Week 4:** Use temporal compositing (same approach as Week 3) to create cloud-free composites for both sensors over the same time period.

## Implementation Strategy: Fine-Tuning Workflow

### Step-by-Step Fine-Tuning Process

**Phase 1: Prepare Multi-Sensor Dataset**

1. Load Sentinel-2 composite (from Week 3)
2. Load MODIS NDVI composite (same time period)
3. Load SRTM DEM
4. Resample MODIS and DEM to 10m resolution
5. Stack into 8-band composite: [B2, B3, B4, B8, B11, B12, MODIS_NDVI, DEM]
6. Extract patches at training polygon locations (reuse Week 3 polygons)

**Phase 2: Load Pretrained Model**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0

# Load pretrained model (ImageNet weights)
base_model = EfficientNetB0(
    weights='imagenet',
    include_top=False,  # Remove classification head
    input_shape=(8, 8, 3)  # Will modify for 8 bands
)
```

**Challenge:** ImageNet models expect 3-band RGB input, but we have 8 bands.

**Solutions:**
1. **Band selection**: Use only RGB bands (B4, B3, B2) — loses information
2. **Band averaging**: Average 8 bands into 3 pseudo-RGB — loses spectral detail
3. **Input layer modification**: Replace first conv layer to accept 8 bands — **recommended**

**Phase 3: Modify Architecture**

```python
# Option 3: Modify input layer
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Create new input layer for 8 bands
inputs = layers.Input(shape=(8, 8, 8))

# Transfer weights from first conv layer (3 bands → 8 bands)
# Method: Repeat RGB weights across bands, then fine-tune
x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, strides=2, padding='same')(inputs)

# Connect to rest of pretrained model (skip first layer)
x = base_model.layers[2](x)  # Start from second layer
for layer in base_model.layers[3:]:
    x = layer(x)

# Add new classification head
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)
outputs = layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')(x)  # 5 classes

model = models.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

**Phase 4: Configure Training**

```python
# Freeze early layers (transfer learned features)
for layer in base_model.layers[:100]:  # Freeze first 100 layers
    layer.trainable = False

# Compile with low learning rate
model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-4),  # 10x lower than training from scratch
    loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

**Phase 5: Train and Evaluate**

```python
# Train with callbacks
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    callbacks=[
        tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10, restore_best_weights=True),
        tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(factor=0.5, patience=5),
        tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint('best_transfer_model.h5', save_best_only=True)
    ]
)
```

### Learning Rate Strategy

**Critical insight:** Transfer learning requires careful learning rate tuning.

**Why lower learning rates?**
- Pretrained weights are already good—don't want to destroy them
- Fine-tuning = small adjustments, not radical changes
- High learning rates can cause "catastrophic forgetting"

**Recommended strategy:**

| Training Phase | Learning Rate | Layers Trainable |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** (warmup) | 1e-4 | Only new head |
| **Phase 2** (fine-tune) | 1e-5 | Last 50 layers |
| **Phase 3** (full fine-tune) | 1e-6 | All layers |

**For Week 4:** Use Phase 1-2 approach (most common and effective).

## Evaluation and Comparison

### Metrics to Track

- **Accuracy relative to a same-dataset baseline** (avoid cross-dataset comparisons)
- **Convergence behavior** (epochs, stability), not just peak accuracy
- **Per-class performance** (watch for systematic failures like Water, or model collapse predicting single class)
- **Impact of architectural choices** (freeze ratio, patch size, LR)
- **Fusion strategy effects** (early vs late/decision), and sensor contributions (DEM vs MODIS)
- **⚠️ Warning signs of failure**:
  - Model predicts single class for all inputs (model collapse)
  - Validation accuracy flat at 0% or near-random (20% for 5 classes)
  - Results significantly worse than training from scratch baseline

### Ablation Studies

- **Single-sensor vs fusion** on the SAME dataset/splits (critical: use stratified splits)
- **Freeze ratios**: early layers only vs aggressive freezing (>80% freezing risks collapse)
- **Patch sizes**: 8×8 native vs larger native patches (no upsampling recommended)
- **Fusion strategies**: early (pixel-level) vs late/decision
- **Sensors**: S2 only, S2+DEM, S2+MODIS, Full fusion (expectations are exploratory, not guaranteed gains)
  - **Key finding from experiments**: DEM (30m→10m) contributed more than MODIS (250m→10m)
  - **Full fusion (8 bands)** may underperform if training data insufficient (<500 samples)

**Critical validation step**: Always verify class distribution in train/val splits before training! Use stratified splitting to ensure all classes represented.

**Document all experiments** in your baseline report!

## Guided Examples and Demonstrations

### Example 1: Loading and Modifying EfficientNet

Note: EfficientNet-B0 is shown here for instructional purposes. In this environment a known bug prevents successful use; the experiments and results in Week 4 used ResNet-50 instead (see Reality Check and Phase 4C references).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load pretrained model
base_model = EfficientNetB0(
    weights='imagenet',
    include_top=False,
    input_shape=(8, 8, 3)
)

print(f"Base model layers: {len(base_model.layers)}")
print(f"Base model parameters: {base_model.count_params():,}")

# Modify for 8-band input
inputs = layers.Input(shape=(8, 8, 8), name='multispectral_input')

# Option: Average 8 bands to 3 pseudo-RGB
x = layers.Conv2D(3, 1, activation='relu', name='band_reduction')(inputs)

# Connect to pretrained model
x = base_model(x)

# Add classification head
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)
outputs = layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax', name='land_cover_output')(x)

# Create model
transfer_model = models.Model(inputs, outputs, name='EfficientNet_Transfer')

transfer_model.summary()
```

**Expected output:**
```
Model: "EfficientNet_Transfer"
Total params: 5,330,571
Trainable params: 5,288,459
Non-trainable params: 42,112
```

### Example 2: Multi-Sensor Data Fusion

```python
import ee
import geemap
import numpy as np

# Initialize Earth Engine
ee.Initialize()

# Load AOI
aoi = ee.FeatureCollection('path/to/aoi').geometry()

# Define time period (austral summer 2019)
start_date = '2019-01-01'
end_date = '2019-03-31'

# === Sentinel-2 Composite ===
s2 = (ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR')
    .filterBounds(aoi)
    .filterDate(start_date, end_date)
    .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 20))
    .select(['B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B8', 'B11', 'B12'])
    .median()
    .clip(aoi))

# === MODIS NDVI Composite ===
modis = (ee.ImageCollection('MODIS/006/MOD13Q1')
    .filterBounds(aoi)
    .filterDate(start_date, end_date)
    .select('NDVI')
    .median()
    .multiply(0.0001)  # Scale factor
    .clip(aoi))

# Resample MODIS to 10m (Sentinel-2 resolution)
modis_10m = modis.resample('bilinear').reproject(
    crs=s2.projection(),
    scale=10
)

# === SRTM DEM ===
dem = ee.Image('USGS/SRTMGL1_003').select('elevation').clip(aoi)

# Resample DEM to 10m
dem_10m = dem.resample('bicubic').reproject(
    crs=s2.projection(),
    scale=10
)

# === Fuse all sources ===
fused = s2.addBands(modis_10m).addBands(dem_10m)

print("Fused image bands:", fused.bandNames().getInfo())
# Output: ['B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B8', 'B11', 'B12', 'NDVI', 'elevation']

# Visualize
Map = geemap.Map()
Map.centerObject(aoi, 10)
Map.addLayer(s2, {'bands': ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], 'min': 0, 'max': 3000}, 'Sentinel-2')
Map.addLayer(modis_10m, {'min': 0, 'max': 1, 'palette': ['brown', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'MODIS NDVI')
Map.addLayer(dem_10m, {'min': 0, 'max': 2000, 'palette': ['blue', 'green', 'red']}, 'DEM')
Map
```

## Hands-on Activities

### Activity 1: Prepare Multi-Sensor Dataset (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Create 8-band fused dataset combining Sentinel-2, MODIS, and DEM.

**Tasks**:
1. Load Week 3 training polygons
2. Create Sentinel-2 composite (reuse Week 3 code)
3. Create MODIS NDVI composite (same time period)
4. Load SRTM DEM
5. Resample MODIS and DEM to 10m
6. Stack into 8-band image
7. Extract patches at polygon locations
8. Verify patch quality (no NaN, correct shape)

**Deliverable**: `X_train_fused.npy` (300 patches, 8×8×8), `X_val_fused.npy` (75 patches, 8×8×8)

**Self-Assessment**:
- Do all patches have 8 bands?
- Are MODIS and DEM properly aligned with Sentinel-2?
- Do patches cover the same locations as Week 3?

### Activity 2: Implement Transfer Learning (90 minutes)

**Objective**: Fine-tune EfficientNet-B0 on fused dataset.

**Tasks**:
1. Load pretrained EfficientNet-B0
2. Modify input layer for 8 bands
3. Add classification head for 5 classes
4. Freeze early layers (first 100)
5. Compile with Adam (lr=1e-4)
6. Train with early stopping
7. Save best model

**Deliverable**: `best_transfer_model.h5`, training curves

**Self-Assessment**:
- Did the model train stably without collapse (no single-class predictions)?
- Are validation curves informative (not flat due to over-freezing)?
- Did freezing ratio and LR choices lead to measurable changes?
- Are results reproducible with stratified splits and documented config?
- **If accuracy did not improve, is there a clear hypothesis and next step?**
  - Try reducing freeze ratio (50-70% instead of 85%)
  - Extract larger patches (32×32 native, no upsampling)
  - Compare to SimpleCNN trained from scratch
  - Consider: Transfer learning may not be appropriate for this task

### Activity 3: Ablation Study (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Compare single-sensor vs fusion, transfer vs from scratch.

**Tasks**:
1. Train on Sentinel-2 only (6 bands)
2. Train on Sentinel-2 + MODIS (7 bands)
3. Train on full fusion (8 bands)
4. Compare accuracies
5. Visualize confusion matrices
6. Document findings

**Deliverable**: Comparison table, confusion matrices, analysis

**Self-Assessment**:
- Does fusion improve accuracy? (**Note**: May not improve if data insufficient)
- Which sensor contributes most? (**Expected**: DEM > MODIS due to resolution difference)
- Can you explain why? (Consider: spatial resolution, resampling artifacts, dataset size)
- **If fusion decreased performance**: Is training data sufficient for higher-dimensional input? (Need ~500-1000 samples for 8 bands)

## Reality Check: What We Observed in Practice

### Experimental Results from Week 4 Implementation

**Phase 4A: Transfer Learning (ResNet50, S2 only, 6 bands)**
- Result: **13.33% accuracy** (vs Week 3 baseline 86.67%)
- Failure mode: Model collapse (predicted only Agriculture class)
- Root causes: 85% layers frozen (too aggressive), 8×8→32×32 upsampling artifacts, ImageNet domain mismatch
- **Lesson**: Transfer learning with aggressive freezing can fail catastrophically

**Phase 4B: Transfer Learning + Multi-Sensor Fusion (ResNet50, 8 bands)**
- Result: **0.00% accuracy** (complete failure)
- Failure mode: Validation accuracy flat at 0% across all epochs
- Root causes: Same transfer learning issues + added complexity of 8-band input
- **Lesson**: Adding more sensors doesn't fix fundamental architecture/training problems

**Phase 4C: SimpleCNN + Multi-Sensor Fusion (trained from scratch, ablation study)**
- Results: S2-only (48%), S2+MODIS (53%), **S2+DEM (69% best)**, Full Fusion (44%)
- Key findings:
  - **SimpleCNN trained successfully** (unlike ResNet50 which collapsed)
  - **DEM (30m→10m) >> MODIS (250m→10m)** - elevation more useful than vegetation index
  - **Full fusion (8 bands) worst** - 300 training samples insufficient for 8-dimensional input
  - **Dataset issue discovered**: Validation set initially had only 1 class (fixed with stratified splitting)
- **Lesson**: More data ≠ better performance; dataset size must scale with input dimensionality

### Key Takeaways

1. **Training from scratch (SimpleCNN) outperformed transfer learning (ResNet50)** for this small, domain-specific dataset
2. **Multi-sensor fusion decreased performance** due to insufficient training data (need 500-1000 samples for 8 bands)
3. **Stratified splitting is critical** - validation set must have all classes represented
4. **Negative results are scientifically valid** - Phase 4A/4B failures taught us when NOT to use transfer learning
5. **Recommendations if replicating**:
   - Use less aggressive freezing (50-70%, not 85%)
   - Extract larger native patches (32×32 or 64×64, no upsampling)
   - Increase training data to 500-1000 samples before attempting fusion
   - Try late fusion (separate models per sensor) instead of early fusion
   - Always validate class distribution before training

✅ Modify pretrained models for multispectral input  
✅ Fuse multiple data sources programmatically  
✅ Fine-tune models with appropriate learning rates  
✅ Compare transfer learning to training from scratch

## Reflection and Discussion

### Key Questions

**1. Transfer Learning Effectiveness**

*"What did transfer learning allow you to achieve that training from scratch would not? Or did it underperform expectations?"*

Consider:
- **Accuracy comparison**: Did transfer learning improve over training from scratch? (Our experiments: No, SimpleCNN outperformed ResNet50)
- **Training efficiency**: Did it converge faster? (Our experiments: ResNet50 converged quickly but to wrong answer)
- **When it works**: Sufficient data (>1000 samples), moderate freeze ratio (50-70%), appropriate patch size (≥32×32)
- **When it fails**: Small data (<500 samples), aggressive freezing (>80%), severe domain mismatch (ImageNet vs multispectral)

**2. Multi-Sensor Fusion Trade-offs**

*"What trade-offs emerged in combining multiple data sources?"*

Consider:
- **Complexity**: Alignment, resampling artifacts (especially MODIS 250m→10m upsampling)
- **Computational cost**: Larger input (8 bands vs 6), more processing time
- **Interpretability**: Harder to explain 8-band model vs single-sensor
- **Accuracy trade-off**: Our experiments showed **fusion decreased performance** (69% vs 86% baseline)
  - Why? Insufficient training data (300 samples) for 8-dimensional input space
  - Rule of thumb: Need 50-100 samples per input dimension for CNNs
  - **Lesson**: More data ≠ better performance if dataset doesn't scale proportionally

**3. Data Inequality**

*"How do domain differences across sensors mirror inequities in global data access?"*

Consider:
- Sentinel-2 coverage (global but recent, 2015+)
- MODIS coverage (global, long time series, 2000+)
- High-resolution commercial imagery (expensive, limited access)
- Ground truth labels (concentrated in wealthy regions)
- Model performance disparities across regions

## Preview of Week 5

Next week, you'll explore **representation learning and self-supervision**:

- Visualize embeddings with UMAP
- Understand what CNNs learn (feature space analysis)
- Introduction to self-supervised learning (SimCLR, BYOL)
- Prepare for learning without labels

**Connection to Week 4:** Transfer learning uses supervised pretraining (ImageNet labels). Self-supervised learning removes the need for labels entirely, learning representations from data structure alone.

## Glossary

**Transfer Learning**: Using knowledge learned from one task to improve learning on a related task.

**Fine-Tuning**: Training a pretrained model on new data with a low learning rate to adapt to a new task.

**Feature Extraction**: Using a pretrained model as a fixed feature extractor (frozen weights).

**Domain Shift**: Difference in data distribution between source domain (pretraining) and target domain (fine-tuning).

**Catastrophic Forgetting**: When fine-tuning with too high a learning rate destroys pretrained knowledge.

**Early Fusion**: Combining multiple data sources at the input level (pixel-level).

**Late Fusion**: Combining predictions from multiple models trained on different data sources.

**Residual Connection**: Skip connection that adds input to output, enabling training of very deep networks.

**Compound Scaling**: Systematically scaling network depth, width, and resolution together (EfficientNet).

**Spatial Alignment**: Ensuring multiple data sources have the same coordinate system and resolution.

**Temporal Compositing**: Creating cloud-free images by aggregating multiple dates (median/mean).

**Ablation Study**: Systematically removing components to understand their contribution.

## Notes for Self-Paced Learners

### Time Management

**Estimated time breakdown:**
- Reading study guide: 2-3 hours
- Activity 1 (data fusion): 1-1.5 hours
- Activity 2 (transfer learning): 1.5-2 hours
- Activity 3 (ablation study): 1-1.5 hours
- Documentation and reflection: 1-2 hours
- **Total: 7-10 hours**

**Suggested schedule:**
- Day 1: Read study guide, start Activity 1
- Day 2: Complete Activity 1, start Activity 2
- Day 3: Complete Activity 2, start Activity 3
- Day 4: Complete Activity 3, documentation
- Day 5: Reflection, comparison to Week 3

### Common Challenges

**Challenge 1: Input shape mismatch**
- **Symptom**: "expected input shape (8, 8, 3), got (8, 8, 8)"
- **Solution**: Modify input layer or use band reduction

**Challenge 2: Slow training**
- **Symptom**: Each epoch takes >5 minutes
- **Solution**: Reduce batch size, use mixed precision training

**Challenge 3: Overfitting**
- **Symptom**: Training accuracy 95%, validation accuracy 85%
- **Solution**: Increase dropout, reduce fine-tuning layers

**Challenge 4: MODIS alignment issues**
- **Symptom**: Blocky artifacts in fused patches
- **Solution**: Use bilinear resampling, verify projection match

**Challenge 5: No accuracy improvement**
- **Symptom**: Transfer learning = from scratch accuracy (or worse)
- **Solution**: Try (a) less aggressive freezing (50-70%), (b) lower learning rate (1e-5), (c) larger patches, or (d) train from scratch instead

**Challenge 6: Model collapse (predicts single class)**
- **Symptom**: Validation accuracy stuck at 0-20%, model predicts same class for all inputs
- **Solution**: Check class distribution (use stratified split), reduce freezing ratio, increase learning rate

**Challenge 7: Validation set imbalanced**
- **Symptom**: Validation set has only 1-2 classes, training set has all classes
- **Solution**: Use `train_test_split(..., stratify=y)` to ensure balanced splits

**Challenge 8: Transfer learning underperforms training from scratch**
- **Symptom**: ResNet50 gets 13%, SimpleCNN gets 86%
- **Solution**: For small, domain-specific datasets, training from scratch may be better than transfer learning

### Extension Activities

**For faster learners:**

1. **Try different architectures**: Compare ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B1, MobileNet
2. **Add more sensors**: Include Landsat-8, SAR (Sentinel-1)
3. **Temporal fusion**: Stack multiple dates instead of compositing
4. **Attention mechanisms**: Add spatial attention to fusion
5. **Export to production**: Convert model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment

**For deeper understanding:**

1. **Visualize learned features**: Use Grad-CAM on transfer model
2. **Analyze layer importance**: Freeze different layer groups, compare performance
3. **Study failure cases**: Which patches are misclassified and why?
4. **Cross-region transfer**: Train on Los Lagos, test on different region
5. **Read original papers**: EfficientNet, ResNet, domain adaptation papers
