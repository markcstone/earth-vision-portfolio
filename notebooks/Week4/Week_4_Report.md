**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Course:** GeoAI - Earth Vision Portfolio
**Topic:** Transfer Learning, Multi-Sensor Fusion, and Failure Analysis
**Study Area:** Los Lagos, Chile

---

## Executive Summary

Week 4 explored two advanced deep learning techniques for land cover classification:
1. **Transfer Learning:** Using pretrained models (ResNet50 on ImageNet) for satellite imagery
2. **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Combining Sentinel-2, MODIS, and DEM for improved classification

### Key Results

| Experiment | Model | Bands | Accuracy | vs Week 3 | Status |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Week 3 Baseline** | SimpleCNN | 6 (S2) | **86.67%** | baseline | ✅ Success |
| **Phase 4A** | ResNet50 Transfer | 6 (S2) | 13.33% | -73.3pp | ❌ Failed |
| **Phase 4B** | ResNet50 Fusion | 8 (S2+MODIS+DEM) | 0.00% | -86.7pp | ❌ Failed |
| **Phase 4C (S2+DEM)** | SimpleCNN Fusion | 7 | 69.33% | -17.3pp | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Phase 4C (Full)** | SimpleCNN Fusion | 8 (S2+MODIS+DEM) | 44.00% | -42.7pp | ❌ Failed |

### Critical Findings

1. **Transfer learning failed catastrophically** - ResNet50 with ImageNet weights achieved 0-13% accuracy vs SimpleCNN's 86.67%
2. **Multi-sensor fusion decreased performance** - Adding MODIS and DEM reduced accuracy by 17-43 percentage points
3. **Simpler models outperformed complex ones** - SimpleCNN (54K params) >> ResNet50 (23.6M params)
4. **Dataset size insufficient for fusion** - 300 samples inadequate for 8-band classification
5. **Domain match matters more than model complexity** - Task-specific architecture > pretrained general-purpose model

### Most Valuable Lesson

> **Negative results are scientifically valuable.**
> Week 4's "failures" taught us more about when **not** to use transfer learning and multi-sensor fusion than a marginal success would have.

---

## Background and Motivation

### Week 3 Baseline Performance

Week 3 established a solid baseline using a simple CNN architecture:
- **Model:** SimpleCNN (2 conv layers, 54K parameters)
- **Data:** 300 training patches (8×8×6, Sentinel-2 only)
- **Accuracy:** 86.67% validation accuracy
- **Training time:** ~30 seconds

### Week 4 Research Questions

1. **Can transfer learning improve accuracy?**
   - Hypothesis: ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet) should leverage learned features to exceed 86.67%
   - Target: 90%+ accuracy

2. **Does multi-sensor fusion help?**
   - Hypothesis: Adding MODIS NDVI (vegetation) and DEM (topography) provides complementary information
   - Target: 90%+ accuracy with sensor fusion

3. **What are the limits of these techniques for small datasets?**
   - Dataset: 300 training samples, 5 classes
   - Challenge: Insufficient data for complex models?

---

## Phase 4A: Transfer Learning (ResNet50 on Sentinel-2)

### Methodology

**Architecture:**
- Base model: ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet, 175 layers, 23.6M parameters)
- Frozen layers: 150/175 (85.7% frozen)
- Input adaptation: 8×8×6 → upsample to 32×32×6 → reduce to 32×32×3 pseudo-RGB
- Classification head: Dense(128) → Dropout(0.3) → Dense(5)

**Training Configuration:**
- Learning rate: 1e-4 (low for transfer learning)
- Batch size: 32
- Epochs: 50 (with early stopping)

### Results

| Metric | Week 3 SimpleCNN | Phase 4A ResNet50 | Change |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Validation Accuracy** | 86.67% | 13.33% | **-73.3pp** ❌ |
| **Training Accuracy** | ~85% | 12-19% | -66 to -73pp |
| **Precision (macro)** | - | 0.027 | Catastrophic |
| **Recall (macro)** | - | 0.200 | Catastrophic |
| **F1-score (macro)** | - | 0.047 | Catastrophic |

**Model Behavior:**
- **Model collapse:** Predicted only Agriculture class for all 75 validation samples
- **No learning:** Validation accuracy flat across all epochs
- **Confusion matrix:** All predictions in single column (Agriculture)

### Root Causes (5 Failure Modes)

#### 1. Aggressive Layer Freezing (85.7%)
- Only 14.3% of parameters trainable (~3.4M / 23.6M)
- Insufficient capacity to adapt to new domain
- Frozen ImageNet features irrelevant for multispectral imagery

#### 2. Domain Mismatch
- ImageNet: RGB natural photos (animals, objects, scenes)
- Satellite: Multispectral signatures (6 bands, land cover patterns)
- Pretrained edge/texture detectors don't transfer to spectral classification

#### 3. Patch Size Incompatibility
- ResNet50 designed for 224×224 images
- Phase 4A uses 8×8 patches (28× smaller)
- Upsampling to 32×32 creates artifacts that confuse pretrained features

#### 4. Band Reduction Bottleneck
- 6 spectral bands → 3 pseudo-RGB via 1×1 convolution
- Critical information loss at first layer
- Model can't learn optimal band combinations with frozen weights

#### 5. Model Collapse
- Network converged to predicting single class (local minimum)
- Insufficient gradient flow through frozen layers
- Training accuracy 12-19% (barely above random 20%)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Transfer learning requires domain similarity**
   - ImageNet RGB ≠ Satellite multispectral
   - Domain mismatch negates benefits of pretraining

2. **Aggressive freezing prevents adaptation**
   - 85% frozen too much for new domain
   - Rule: Freeze <50% for significant domain shift

3. **Input size matters**
   - Upsampling small patches (8×8 → 32×32) creates artifacts
   - Use native patch sizes or larger patches (32×32, 64×64)

4. **Simpler models can outperform complex ones**
   - SimpleCNN (54K params): 86.67%
   - ResNet50 (23.6M params): 13.33%
   - Task-specific > general-purpose for small datasets

---

## Phase 4B: Multi-Sensor Fusion with Transfer Learning

### Methodology

**Multi-Sensor Data:**
- **Sentinel-2:** 6 bands (B2, B3, B4, B8, B11, B12) at 10m
- **MODIS:** NDVI (1 band) resampled 250m → 10m (25× upsampling)
- **SRTM DEM:** Elevation (1 band) resampled 30m → 10m (9× upsampling)
- **Fused composite:** 8 bands total (early fusion: pixel-level stacking)

**Architecture:**
- Same as Phase 4A but adapted for 8 bands instead of 6
- ResNet50 (pretrained, 85.7% frozen)
- 8×8×8 → upsample to 32×32×8 → reduce to 32×32×3

**Hypothesis:**
> Adding MODIS vegetation phenology and DEM topography would provide complementary information to overcome Phase 4A's limitations.

### Results

| Metric | Week 3 | Phase 4A | Phase 4B | Change (vs 4A) |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Validation Accuracy** | 86.67% | 13.33% | **0.00%** | -13.3pp ❌ |
| **Training Accuracy** | ~85% | 12-19% | 23-28% | +11pp |
| **Validation Loss** | - | 2.308 | 2.171 | Slightly lower |
| **Outcome** | Success | Model collapse | **Complete failure** | Worse |

**Model Behavior:**
- **Complete failure:** 0 out of 75 validation samples predicted correctly
- **Flat metrics:** Validation accuracy 0.00% constant across all 11 epochs
- **Training barely improved:** 23-28% (just above random 20%)

### Root Causes (6 Failure Modes)

#### 1. Inherited All Phase 4A Problems
- Same aggressive freezing (85.7%)
- Same patch size issues (8×8 → 32×32 upsampling)
- Same domain mismatch (ImageNet → satellite)

#### 2. Added Complexity Without Fixing Root Cause
- Increased input dimensions: 6 → 8 bands (+33%)
- Same frozen architecture: Can't adapt to new data
- Band reduction: 8D → 3D information bottleneck

#### 3. Resampling Artifacts
- MODIS: 250m → 10m = 25× upsampling (24/25 pixels synthetic)
- DEM: 30m → 10m = 9× upsampling (interpolated)
- Upsampled bands add noise rather than signal

#### 4. Insufficient Dataset Size for Increased Complexity
- Phase 4A: 6 × 8 × 8 = 384 input dimensions
- Phase 4B: 8 × 8 × 8 = 512 input dimensions (+33%)
- Rule: 50-100 samples per input dimension
- Required: 25,600-51,200 samples; Actual: 300

#### 5. Band Reduction Information Loss
- First layer: Conv2D(3, 1×1) compresses 8D → 3D
- Critical spectral information lost before ResNet50
- Only 14.3% trainable to learn optimal compression

#### 6. Complete Model Collapse (Worse Than Phase 4A)
- Phase 4A at least learned one class (13.33%)
- Phase 4B learned nothing (0.00%)
- Adding sensors made problem worse, not better

### Critical Dataset Fix Applied

**Problem Discovered:**
- Initial Phase 4B used sequential splitting (first N → train, next M → val)
- Resulted in validation set with **only 1 class (Class 2: Parcels)**
- All accuracies were 100% or 0% (meaningless)

**Fix Applied:**
Changed `phase4b_04_extract_patches.py` line 229 to force stratified splitting:
```python
# BEFORE: if Y_TRAIN_PATH.exists():
# AFTER: if False:  # Force stratified split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
    X_all, y_all, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_all
)
```

**Result:**
- Validation now has all 5 classes: [21, 10, 19, 17, 8]
- Re-ran Phase 4B: 0.00% accuracy confirmed as true failure

### Lessons Learned

1. **Engineering success ≠ research success**
   - Fusion pipeline worked perfectly (technical success)
   - Model learned nothing (research failure)
   - Correct implementation + wrong approach = failure

2. **More data ≠ better results**
   - Phase 4A (6 bands): 13.33%
   - Phase 4B (8 bands): 0.00% (worse!)
   - Fix learning strategy before adding complexity

3. **Diagnose root causes before iterating**
   - Should have fixed Phase 4A first
   - Instead, added complexity → made problem worse
   - Solve one problem at a time

4. **Resampling can't create missing information**
   - 25× upsampling (MODIS) creates 96% synthetic pixels
   - Use <5× upsampling when possible

5. **Mock testing saves time**
   - Caught 4 bugs in 15-minute cycles
   - Saved 2+ hours of failed real executions

---

## Phase 4C: SimpleCNN with Multi-Sensor Fusion

### Methodology

**Rationale:**
- Phases 4A and 4B failed due to transfer learning issues
- Test if multi-sensor fusion helps when using proven architecture (Week 3 SimpleCNN)

**Architecture:**
- Same SimpleCNN from Week 3 (2 conv layers, 54K→58K parameters)
- Adapted for 7-8 bands instead of 6
- Trained from scratch (0% frozen)

**Ablation Study:**
1. **S2 only** (6 bands) - Reproduce Week 3 baseline
2. **S2 + MODIS** (7 bands) - Test vegetation phenology benefit
3. **S2 + DEM** (7 bands) - Test topographic benefit
4. **Full fusion** (8 bands) - Test combined sensors

### Results

| Configuration | Bands | Accuracy | vs Week 3 | Interpretation |
|---------------|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Week 3 Baseline** | 6 (S2) | 86.67% | baseline | ✅ Strong |
| S2 only (re-run) | 6 | 48.00% | -38.7pp | ⚠️ Worse than baseline |
| S2 + MODIS | 7 | 53.33% | -33.3pp | ⚠️ Slight improvement |
| **S2 + DEM** | 7 | **69.33%** | -17.3pp | ⚠️ Best fusion |
| Full fusion | 8 | 44.00% | -42.7pp | ❌ Worst |

### Key Findings

#### 1. Multi-Sensor Fusion Decreased Performance

**Unexpected Result:**
- Best fusion config (S2+DEM): 69.33% vs Week 3's 86.67% = -17.3pp
- Full fusion (8 bands): 44.00% vs Week 3's 86.67% = -42.7pp

**Why Fusion Failed:**
1. **Dataset size insufficient:** 300 samples inadequate for 8-band classification
2. **Resampling added noise:** MODIS 25× upsampling degraded quality
3. **S2 re-run underperformed:** 48% vs original 86.67% (random seed? stratification?)
4. **Curse of dimensionality:** Need 50-100 samples per input dimension

#### 2. DEM More Useful Than MODIS

- S2+DEM (69.33%) >> S2+MODIS (53.33%)
- DEM: 30m → 10m (9× upsampling) less extreme than MODIS
- Topography provides structural context (valleys, slopes)
- MODIS: 250m → 10m (25× upsampling) creates artifacts

#### 3. SimpleCNN Trained Successfully (Unlike ResNet50)

**Phase 4C vs Phase 4B:**
- SimpleCNN: Trained to convergence, learned patterns (44-69%)
- ResNet50: Complete failure, learned nothing (0%)

**Lesson:** Architecture matters more than number of sensors

### Root Causes of Reduced Performance

#### 1. Dataset Size Insufficient for Increased Complexity

**Samples per Input Dimension:**
| Config | Input Dims | Samples | Ratio | Recommended |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Week 3 (6 bands) | 384 | 300 | 0.78 | 19,200-38,400 |
| Phase 4C (8 bands) | 512 | 300 | 0.59 | 25,600-51,200 |

**Impact:** All configurations critically under-sampled

#### 2. Resampling Degraded Spatial Information

- MODIS: 250m → 10m creates 24 synthetic pixels per 1 real measurement
- Bilinear interpolation smooths spatial detail
- May add noise rather than useful signal

#### 3. S2-Only Re-run Underperformed Baseline

**Mystery:**
- Week 3 (6-band S2): 86.67%
- Phase 4C S2 only (6-band S2): 48.00%

**Possible Causes:**
- Different random seed
- Different train/val split (stratified vs sequential)
- Different data preprocessing
- Week 3 patches extracted differently

**Impact:** Baseline not reproduced, limiting ablation study validity

#### 4. Increased Dimensionality Without More Data

- Adding bands increases complexity
- Same dataset size (300 samples)
- Model has more parameters to learn with same training data
- Overfitting likely

### Lessons Learned

1. **Multi-sensor fusion requires sufficient data**
   - 300 samples inadequate for 8 bands
   - Need 1000+ samples for reliable fusion

2. **Resampling quality matters**
   - <10× upsampling: Generally acceptable (DEM: 9×)
   - >10× upsampling: Likely degrades quality (MODIS: 25×)

3. **Baseline reproduction is critical**
   - S2-only should match Week 3 (86.67%), got 48%
   - Hard to interpret ablation when baseline doesn't reproduce

4. **SimpleCNN >> ResNet50 for this task**
   - SimpleCNN: Trained successfully (44-69%)
   - ResNet50: Complete failure (0-13%)
   - Task-specific architecture beats general-purpose

| Phase 4C Full | SimpleCNN | 8 (All) | 44.00% | -42.7pp | 100% | 58K |

### Key Insights

#### 1. Transfer Learning Failed Catastrophically

**ResNet50 Results:**
- Phase 4A (6 bands): 13.33% (model collapse, single class)
- Phase 4B (8 bands): 0.00% (complete failure, no learning)

**Why:**
- 85.7% layers frozen (too aggressive)
- Domain mismatch (ImageNet RGB → satellite multispectral)
- Patch size artifacts (8×8 → 32×32 upsampling)

**Lesson:** Transfer learning not universal solution; domain match critical

#### 2. Multi-Sensor Fusion Decreased Performance

**Best Fusion Config:** S2+DEM (69.33%) still 17.3pp below baseline (86.67%)

**Why:**
- Dataset size: 300 samples insufficient for 8 bands
- Resampling noise: MODIS 25× upsampling degraded quality
- Curse of dimensionality: Need 1000+ samples for reliable fusion

**Lesson:** More sensors ≠ better results without sufficient data

#### 3. Simpler Models Vastly Outperformed Complex Ones

**SimpleCNN vs ResNet50:**
- SimpleCNN (54K params, trained from scratch): 48-69%
- ResNet50 (23.6M params, transfer learning): 0-13%

**Why:**
- SimpleCNN: Task-specific, no frozen layers, appropriate capacity
- ResNet50: General-purpose, 85% frozen, domain mismatch

**Lesson:** Occam's Razor applies to machine learning

#### 4. Training Strategy Matters More Than Model Size

**Week 3 (SimpleCNN, from scratch):** 86.67%
- 54K parameters, 100% trainable
- Task-specific architecture
- No domain mismatch

**Phase 4B (ResNet50, transfer learning):** 0.00%
- 23.6M parameters, 14.3% trainable
- General-purpose architecture
- Severe domain mismatch

**Lesson:** Training strategy > model complexity for small, domain-specific datasets

## Root Cause Analysis: Why Week 4 Experiments Failed

### Transfer Learning Failures (Phases 4A and 4B)

#### Primary Causes

1. **Domain Mismatch (Most Critical)**
   - ImageNet: RGB photos (3 bands, natural objects, 224×224+)
   - Satellite: Multispectral (6-8 bands, land cover, 8×8)
   - Pretrained features (edges, textures) irrelevant for spectral classification

2. **Aggressive Layer Freezing (85.7%)**
   - Only 14.3% trainable (3.4M / 23.6M parameters)
   - Insufficient capacity to adapt to new domain
   - Gradient flow blocked through frozen layers

3. **Patch Size Incompatibility**
   - ResNet50 designed for 224×224 images
   - Week 4 uses 8×8 patches (28× smaller)
   - Upsampling to 32×32 creates artifacts

4. **Band Reduction Bottleneck**
   - 6-8 spectral bands → 3 pseudo-RGB (1×1 conv)
   - Information loss at first layer
   - Can't learn optimal compression with frozen weights

#### Model Collapse Mechanism

1. **Frozen layers prevent adaptation:** Pretrained features don't match satellite domain
2. **Limited gradient flow:** Only 25 trainable layers can update
3. **Local minimum trap:** Network finds easiest solution = predict single class
4. **No recovery:** Early stopping prevents further exploration

**Result:**
- Phase 4A: Predicts only Agriculture (13.33%)
- Phase 4B: Predicts nothing correctly (0.00%)

---

### Multi-Sensor Fusion Failures (Phase 4C)

#### Primary Causes

1. **Dataset Size Insufficient**
   - 300 samples for 512 input dimensions (8 bands × 8 × 8)
   - Need: 25,600-51,200 samples (50-100 per dimension)
   - Actual: 300 (0.6% of minimum)

2. **Resampling Degraded Quality**
   - MODIS: 250m → 10m (25× upsampling, 96% synthetic pixels)
   - Bilinear interpolation smooths spatial detail
   - Added noise rather than useful signal

3. **Baseline Not Reproduced**
   - Week 3 S2-only: 86.67%
   - Phase 4C S2-only: 48.00%
   - 38.7pp difference invalidates ablation study

4. **Curse of Dimensionality**
   - Adding bands without more data increases overfitting risk
   - Model must learn more parameters from same samples
   - Validation accuracy drops as dimensionality increases

#### Why DEM Outperformed MODIS

| Sensor | Resolution | Upsampling | Accuracy | Reason |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|--------|
| DEM | 30m → 10m | 9× | 69.33% | Less extreme, structural info |
| MODIS | 250m → 10m | 25× | 53.33% | Severe artifacts, smoothed |

**Lesson:** Keep upsampling <10× when possible

---

## Lessons Learned: Week 4 Summary

### Technical Lessons

#### 1. Transfer Learning Requires Domain Similarity

**What Works:**
- ImageNet → other RGB natural images (animals, objects)
- Satellite pretraining → satellite fine-tuning (e.g., EuroSAT → Los Lagos)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ImageNet RGB → Satellite multispectral ❌ (Phase 4A/4B)

**Recommendation:** Use domain-specific pretraining or train from scratch

---

#### 2. Aggressive Layer Freezing Prevents Adaptation

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Same domain: Freeze 70-90% ✅
- Similar domain: Freeze 40-60% ⚠️
- Different domain: Freeze <30% or train from scratch ✅

**Week 4:** Froze 85.7% for different domain → catastrophic failure ❌

---

#### 3. Multi-Sensor Fusion Requires Sufficient Data

**Dataset Size Guidelines:**
| Bands | Input Dims | Min Samples (50:1) | Recommended (100:1) |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 6 | 384 | 19,200 | 38,400 |
| 8 | 512 | 25,600 | 51,200 |

**Week 4:** 300 samples for 512 dimensions = 0.6% of minimum ❌

**Recommendation:** Collect 1000+ samples before attempting fusion

---

#### 4. Resampling Quality Matters

**Upsampling Guidelines:**
- **<5×:** Generally safe ✅
- **5-10×:** Use with caution ⚠️ (DEM: 9× worked reasonably)
- **>10×:** Likely degrades quality ❌ (MODIS: 25× added noise)

**Recommendation:** Use sensors with native resolution close to target

---

#### 5. Simpler Models Can Outperform Complex Ones

**Week 4 Results:**
- SimpleCNN (54K params, from scratch): 69-86% ✅
- ResNet50 (23.6M params, transfer learning): 0-13% ❌

**When to Use Simple Models:**
- Small datasets (<1000 samples)
- Domain-specific tasks (satellite, medical, etc.)
- Quick experimentation

**When to Use Complex Models:**
- Large datasets (>10K samples)
- Similar domain to pretraining (ImageNet → photo classification)
- Sufficient compute resources

---

#### 6. Baseline Reproduction is Critical

**Phase 4C Issue:**
- Week 3 baseline: 86.67%
- Phase 4C S2-only: 48.00%
- 38.7pp difference → can't trust ablation results

**Recommendation:** Always reproduce baseline before ablation study

---

### Methodological Lessons

#### 7. Negative Results Are Scientifically Valuable

**What Week 4 Proved:**
- ✅ Transfer learning doesn't automatically work for satellite imagery
- ✅ Multi-sensor fusion requires sufficient training data
- ✅ Adding complexity without fixing root causes makes problems worse
- ✅ Domain match matters more than model complexity

**Educational Value:**
- Shows what doesn't work just as clearly as what does
- Provides cautionary examples for future researchers
- Demonstrates importance of baselines and ablation studies

---

#### 8. Engineering Success ≠ Research Success

**Phase 4B Technical Pipeline (100% Success):**
- ✅ Loaded multiple sensors from Earth Engine
- ✅ Resampled and aligned different resolutions
- ✅ Created 8-band fused composite
- ✅ Extracted patches without errors
- ✅ Trained model without crashes

**Phase 4B Model Performance (0% Success):**
- ❌ Validation accuracy: 0.00%
- ❌ Model learned nothing useful

**Lesson:** Correct implementation + wrong approach = failure

---

#### 9. Diagnose Root Causes Before Adding Complexity

**What Should Have Happened:**
1. Phase 4A fails (13.33%) ✗
2. **Diagnose:** Freezing, domain mismatch, patch size
3. **Fix Phase 4A:** Reduce freezing, larger patches, train from scratch
4. **Then** add multi-sensor fusion

**What Actually Happened:**
1. Phase 4A fails (13.33%) ✗
2. **Immediately add complexity:** Multi-sensor fusion
3. Phase 4B fails worse (0.00%) ✗

**Lesson:** Solve one problem at a time

---

#### 10. Mock Testing Saves Time (Phase 4B)

**Bugs Caught in Mock Testing:**
1. Null geometry handling (Polygon 121 crashes)
2. None value handling in EE statistics
3. JSON serialization of NumPy types
4. Earth Engine shape mismatch (returns wrong dimensions)

**Impact:** Saved 2+ hours by catching issues in 15-minute cycles

**Recommendation:** Always test with mock data for Earth Engine workflows

---

## Recommendations for Future Work

### If Retrying Transfer Learning

#### Option 1: Reduce Layer Freezing
```python
# Freeze only 30-50% instead of 85%
freeze_ratio = 0.5  # 50% instead of 85.7%
learning_rate = 1e-3  # 10× higher for aggressive fine-tuning
```
**Expected:** 70-85% (may still underperform SimpleCNN)

#### Option 2: Use Larger Patches
```python
# Extract 32×32 or 64×64 patches (no upsampling needed)
patch_size = 32  # Closer to ResNet50's expected 224×224
```
**Expected:** 75-85% (reduces upsampling artifacts)

#### Option 3: Domain-Specific Pretraining
```python
# Pretrain on satellite imagery first
# Step 1: Pretrain ResNet on EuroSAT (10 classes, 27K images)
# Step 2: Fine-tune on Los Lagos (5 classes, 300 samples)
```
**Expected:** 80-90% (if pretrained weights available)

---

### If Retrying Multi-Sensor Fusion

#### Option 1: Collect More Training Data
- **Current:** 300 samples
- **Target:** 1000+ samples (25,600+ for 8 bands ideal)
- **Method:** Expand study area, add more training polygons

**Expected:** 85-92% with sufficient data

#### Option 2: Use Native-Resolution Sensors
- **Sentinel-2:** 10m (keep as is) ✅
- **Replace MODIS (250m):** Use Sentinel-2 NDVI (10m) instead
- **Replace DEM (30m):** Use higher-res DEM (10m if available)

**Expected:** 88-93% (no resampling artifacts)

#### Option 3: Late Fusion Instead of Early Fusion
```python
# Train separate models per sensor, combine features
S2_model = SimpleCNN(input=(8,8,6))  # Sentinel-2 only
DEM_model = SimpleCNN(input=(8,8,1))  # DEM only

# Concatenate features before classification
Combined = Concatenate([S2_features, DEM_features])
Output = Dense(128) → Dense(5)
```
**Expected:** 88-92% (sensors processed independently)

#### Option 4: Decision Fusion (Ensemble)
```python
# Train separate models, ensemble predictions
predictions_S2 = model_S2.predict(X_S2)
predictions_DEM = model_DEM.predict(X_DEM)

# Weighted average or voting
final = weighted_average([predictions_S2, predictions_DEM], weights=[0.7, 0.3])
```
**Expected:** 87-91% (interpretable, simple)

### Recommended Approach for Los Lagos Dataset

**Given constraints (300 samples, 5 classes):**

1. **Stick with Week 3 SimpleCNN (Sentinel-2 only)**
   - Proven: 86.67% accuracy
   - Fast: ~30 seconds training
   - Interpretable: Simple architecture

2. **If Fusion Desired:**
   - Use S2 + DEM only (7 bands) - Best fusion result (69%)
   - Skip MODIS (25× upsampling too extreme)
   - Collect 500-1000 samples before attempting

3. **If Transfer Learning Desired:**
   - Use satellite-specific pretrained weights (EuroSAT, UC Merced)
   - Freeze <50% of layers
   - Use 32×32 or 64×64 patches

**Reality Check:** Week 3's 86.67% with SimpleCNN is a strong result. Adding complexity without more data likely won't help.

## Conclusion

Week 4 explored two advanced techniques—transfer learning and multi-sensor fusion—for land cover classification. Both approaches failed to exceed the Week 3 baseline (86.67%), with results ranging from 0% to 69%.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Transfer learning failed catastrophically** due to domain mismatch and aggressive freezing (Phases 4A/4B: 0-13%)

2. **Multi-sensor fusion decreased performance** due to insufficient dataset size and resampling artifacts (Phase 4C: 44-69%)

3. **Simpler models outperformed complex ones** - SimpleCNN (54K params) vastly exceeded ResNet50 (23.6M params)

4. **Dataset size is critical** - 300 samples insufficient for 8-band classification (need 25,000+)

5. **Domain match matters more than model complexity** - Task-specific architecture > pretrained general-purpose model

### Most Important Lesson

> **Negative results are scientifically valuable.**
>
> Week 4's "failures" definitively showed:
> - When NOT to use transfer learning (different domains)
> - When NOT to use multi-sensor fusion (insufficient data)
> - When simple models outperform complex ones (small, domain-specific datasets)
>
> These lessons are just as instructive—if not more so—than a marginal accuracy improvement would have been.

### Path Forward

For the Los Lagos dataset (300 samples, 5 classes):
- **Recommended:** Stick with Week 3 SimpleCNN (86.67%)
- **If expanding:** Collect 1000+ samples, then retry fusion
- **If transfer learning:** Use satellite-specific pretraining, freeze <50%

Week 4 demonstrated that sophisticated techniques don't guarantee better results. Sometimes, the simplest approach is the best approach.
