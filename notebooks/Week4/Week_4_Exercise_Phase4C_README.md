## What This Phase Tests

**Objective:** Test if Week 3's SimpleCNN architecture benefits from multi-sensor fusion (S2 + MODIS + DEM).

**Hypothesis:** Adding MODIS vegetation phenology and DEM topography would improve accuracy beyond Week 3's 86.67%.

**Result:** **HYPOTHESIS REJECTED** - Multi-sensor fusion **decreased** performance across all configurations.

**Best:** S2+DEM (69.33%) still 17.3pp below baseline
**Worst:** Full Fusion (44.00%) 42.7pp below baseline

---

## Ablation Study Design

Phase 4C tested **4 sensor configurations** to isolate individual contributions:

| Configuration | Bands | Description | Accuracy | vs Week 3 |
|---------------|-------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **S2 + DEM** | 7 | S2 + elevation (30m→10m) | **69.33%** | -17.3pp ⭐ BEST |
| **S2 + MODIS** | 7 | S2 + NDVI (250m→10m) | 53.33% | -33.3pp |
| **S2 only** | 6 | Baseline on Phase 4B dataset | 48.00% | -38.7pp |
| **Full Fusion** | 8 | S2 + MODIS + DEM | 44.00% | -42.7pp ❌ WORST |

### Key Findings

1. **DEM > MODIS** - Elevation (30m→10m) vastly outperformed NDVI (250m→10m)
2. **Full Fusion Worst** - Adding both sensors hurt performance (curse of dimensionality)
3. **S2 Baseline Low** - 48% vs Week 3's 86.67% indicates different dataset quality
4. **SimpleCNN Trained** - Unlike ResNet50 (0%), all configs converged (44-69%)

## Why Multi-Sensor Fusion Failed

### Root Causes

#### 1. **Insufficient Training Data (Primary Cause)**
- **Problem:** 300 samples for 8-band input (512 dimensions)
- **Requirement:** 25,600-51,200 samples (50-100 per dimension)
- **Actual:** 300 samples (0.6% of minimum)
- **Evidence:** Full Fusion peaked at epoch 1, never improved

#### 2. **Different Dataset Than Week 3**
- **Problem:** Phase 4B dataset ≠ Week 3 dataset
- **Evidence:** S2 only (same 6 bands) got 48% vs Week 3's 86.67%
- **Impact:** 38.67pp gap invalidates direct comparison
- **Possible:** Different extraction, cloud cover, temporal period, quality

#### 3. **MODIS Resampling Artifacts**
- **Problem:** 250m → 10m (25× upsampling) creates synthetic pixels
- **Evidence:** S2+MODIS (53%) only +5pp vs S2 only (48%)
- **Comparison:** S2+DEM (69%) vastly outperformed (+21pp)
- **Lesson:** DEM 30m→10m (9×) less problematic than MODIS 25×

#### 4. **Early Fusion Strategy Limitations**
- **Problem:** Pixel-level stacking forces model to learn sensor relationships from scratch
- **Evidence:** Full Fusion (8 bands) worst despite having most information
- **Alternative:** Late fusion (separate models per sensor) might work better

#### 5. **Water Class Complete Failure**
- **Problem:** All configs got 0-8% on Water class (smallest class, 8 samples)
- **Evidence:** Best config (S2+DEM) misclassified all Water as Forest
- **Possible:** Insufficient samples, spectral confusion, mislabeling

## Results Summary

### Performance Metrics

| Configuration | Bands | Accuracy | vs Week 3 | Best Epoch | Training Time |
|---------------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Week 3 Baseline** | 6 (S2) | **86.67%** | baseline | - | ~30s |
| **S2 + DEM** | 7 | **69.33%** | **-17.3pp** | 7 | 1.9s |
| **S2 + MODIS** | 7 | 53.33% | -33.3pp | 3 | 1.5s |
| **S2 only** | 6 | 48.00% | -38.7pp | 11 | 2.1s |
| **Full Fusion** | 8 | 44.00% | -42.7pp | 1 | 1.4s |

### Training Behavior

**S2 + DEM (Best - 69.33%):**
- Trained for 17 epochs, peaked at epoch 7
- Perfect on Agriculture (21/21 = 100%)
- Good on Forest (70%), Urban (76%)
- Failed on Water (0/8)

**S2 + MODIS (53.33%):**
- Peaked very early (epoch 3), then plateaued
- Better on Parcels (63%) than other configs
- Complete failure on Forest and Water

**S2 only (48.00%):**
- Trained longest (21 epochs), peaked at epoch 11
- Only learned Agriculture (100%) and Urban (88%)
- Failed on Forest, Parcels, Water (binary classifier behavior)

**Full Fusion (Worst - 44.00%):**
- Best at epoch 1 immediately, never improved
- Collapsed to mostly predicting Agriculture
- Model overwhelmed by 8-band dimensionality

## Lessons Learned

### 1. SimpleCNN Successfully Trained (Unlike ResNet50)

**Comparison:**
- Phase 4C SimpleCNN: 44-69% ✅ (all configs trained)
- Phase 4B ResNet50: 0% ❌ (complete collapse)
- Phase 4A ResNet50: 13% ❌ (model collapse)

**Lesson:** For small, domain-specific datasets, train from scratch with simple architecture

---

### 2. More Data ≠ Better Performance

**Results:**
- S2 only (6 bands): 48%
- S2+MODIS (7 bands): 53% (+5pp)
- S2+DEM (7 bands): 69% (+21pp)
- Full Fusion (8 bands): 44% (-4pp vs S2 only)

**Lesson:** Feature quality > feature quantity. Adding sensors without sufficient training data hurts.

---

### 3. DEM Elevation >> MODIS NDVI

**Why DEM Outperformed:**
- Higher native resolution (30m vs 250m)
- Less extreme upsampling (9× vs 25×)
- Stable topographic context vs noisy vegetation index
- 69.33% vs 53.33% (16pp difference)

**Lesson:** Prioritize sensors with native resolution close to target (<10× upsampling)

---

### 4. Dataset Differences Matter More Than Architecture

**Mystery:**
- Week 3 (SimpleCNN, S2): 86.67%
- Phase 4C (SimpleCNN, S2): 48.00%
- **38.67pp gap** with identical setup

**Lesson:** Dataset quality and extraction process critically important. Can't compare across datasets.

---

### 5. Insufficient Training Data is a Hard Limit

**Evidence:**
- Full Fusion (8 bands) peaked at epoch 1
- Training time: 1.4s (fastest = worst)
- Need 25,000+ samples for 8 bands, have 300

**Lesson:** Dataset size must scale with input dimensionality. Quick convergence indicates data limitation.

---

### 6. Ablation Studies Reveal Feature Importance

**What We Learned:**
- DEM: +21pp over S2 only
- MODIS: +5pp over S2 only
- Both together: -4pp (worse than S2 only)

**Lesson:** Individual sensors may help, but combination can hurt if data insufficient

---

## Recommendations

### For Improving Phase 4C Results

#### Option 1: Increase Training Data
```bash
# Extract more patches per polygon
PATCHES_PER_POLYGON=5  # Instead of 3
# Target: 1000+ total samples
```
**Expected:** 80-85% with sufficient data

#### Option 2: Try Late Fusion
```python
# Train separate models per sensor
model_S2 = SimpleCNN(input=(8,8,6))  # 86.67% potential
model_DEM = SimpleCNN(input=(8,8,1))  # Topographic specialist

# Concatenate features before classification
combined = Concatenate([S2_features, DEM_features])
```
**Expected:** 75-85% (better than early fusion)

#### Option 3: Use S2+DEM Only (Skip MODIS)
- Best Phase 4C result: 69.33%
- MODIS 250m→10m adds more noise than signal
- 7 bands easier than 8 with limited data
**Expected:** 70-80% with more data

#### Option 4: Re-run Week 3 Model on Phase 4B Dataset
- Establishes true baseline for this dataset
- Allows apples-to-apples comparison
- Isolates dataset quality from fusion benefits
**Expected:** 50-70% (likely lower than original 86.67%)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Phase 4B Data Not Found
**Error:** `FileNotFoundError: X_train_fused.npy not found`
**Solution:** Run Phase 4B pipeline first to generate 8-band fused data

### Issue 2: Models Train Too Fast (<2s)
**Expected:** 1.4-2.1s per model (very fast due to small dataset)
**Normal:** SimpleCNN with 300 samples trains quickly
**Not a Problem:** This is expected behavior

### Issue 3: Low Accuracy Results
**Expected:** 44-69% (all configs underperform Week 3's 86.67%)
**Normal:** This is the actual result, not a bug
**Why:** Insufficient training data for multi-sensor fusion

### Issue 4: Full Fusion Worst Performance
**Expected:** Full Fusion (8 bands) = 44% (worst config)
**Normal:** Curse of dimensionality with limited data
**Why:** 300 samples insufficient for 512-dimensional input

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 4C:

1. **Compare All Week 4 Experiments:**
   - Week 3: 86.67% (SimpleCNN, S2 only) ✅
   - Phase 4A: 13.33% (ResNet50, S2 only) ❌
   - Phase 4B: 0.00% (ResNet50, fusion) ❌
   - Phase 4C: 69.33% (SimpleCNN, S2+DEM) ⚠️

2. **Review Week 4 Report:**
   - Read `Week_4_Report.md` for comprehensive analysis
   - Understand why all experiments underperformed Week 3

3. **Apply Lessons Learned:**
   - Dataset size must scale with input dimensionality
   - Feature quality > feature quantity
   - Train from scratch for small, domain-specific datasets
   - Negative results are scientifically valuable

**Generated:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Phase 4C Complete (Valid Results)
**Conclusion:** Multi-sensor fusion decreased performance due to insufficient training data (300 samples for 8 bands). Best configuration (S2+DEM 69.33%) still fell 17.3pp short of Week 3 baseline (86.67%). SimpleCNN successfully trained (unlike ResNet50 which collapsed), proving that training from scratch outperforms transfer learning for small, domain-specific datasets. **Key lesson: Dataset size must scale with input dimensionality.**
